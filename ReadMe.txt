(4) Introduction:
        MovingKML (http://www.sirrs.org/MoveKml/en/MoveKml.html) is a webpage developed with 
    the Google Earth web browser plug-in and its JavaScript API. The purpose of this webpage
    is to test the effectiveness of our proposed framework for the moving transformation of 
    KML geometry elements within Google Earth. Any computer, which already has the Google Earth 
    web plug-in installed, can freely visit this webpage on a decent broadband connection. After 
    loading a hosted KML/KMZ file from a specified URL, users of this webpage can move multiple 
    KML geometry elements arbitrarily.
